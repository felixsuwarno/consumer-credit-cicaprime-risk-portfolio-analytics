# Consumer Lending “Cica PRIME” Credit Risk and Portfolio Analytics  
**Risk Management • Portfolio Analytics • Forecasting • Stress Testing**

This project analyzes synthetic but realistic consumer installment lending data from CICA (Consumer Installment Credit Account) Prime, a simulated consumer credit product designed to resemble real-world installment lending / BNPL-style portfolios offered by fintechs and traditional banks. The product extends unsecured credit to consumers and generates revenue through interest and fees, while incurring credit losses through delinquency and default.

The dataset spans January 2023 to December 2025 and includes loan-level, customer-level, and payment-level data, along with contractual payment schedules, macroeconomic scenarios, and internal budget plans. The data captures the full credit lifecycle: customer acquisition, underwriting decisions, loan origination, repayment behavior, delinquency, default, recoveries, and portfolio-level financial outcomes.

The analysis focuses on risk-aware, finance-aligned analytics, modeling how portfolio growth, repayment behavior, and credit losses are expected to evolve over time under different conditions. The goal is to evaluate portfolio health, revenue sustainability, and downside risk using predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, and scenario-based stress testing, consistent with how consumer lending analytics teams operate in practice.

<br><br>

➤ **Project Goal / Purpose:**  

The goal of this project is to understand how CICA Prime’s consumer lending portfolio grows over time, how stable that growth is, and how exposed the business is to downside risk. The analysis uses forecasting, predictive modeling, and standard credit risk techniques commonly applied in consumer lending.

The project looks at how revenue, cash inflows, delinquency, and defaults are expected to change over time, and compares actual results to internal plans to evaluate how accurate and resilient the business’s financial planning is. At the borrower and loan level, the analysis estimates customer lifetime value, the likelihood that borrowers stop using the product, and the likelihood that loans default, with the goal of using past behavior to make informed predictions about future outcomes.

At the portfolio level, the project measures expected credit losses, evaluates how concentrated revenue and risk are across borrowers, and tests how the portfolio would perform under different economic conditions. The goal is to determine whether portfolio growth is supported by sustainable cash flows and manageable credit risk, or whether it relies on elevated risk, loose underwriting, or a small group of borrowers—especially when economic conditions worsen.

**➤ The Dataset**

The raw dataset spans January 2023 through December 2025, and all reporting and conclusions in this project are intentionally scoped to this full three-year period to evaluate portfolio growth, seasonality, underwriting changes, and macro-driven risk cycles, while supporting time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, portfolio risk analytics, and stress testing in a consistent analytical framework.

The analysis uses seven core tables representing a consumer installment lending product (“CICA Prime”):

**customers**
- One row per customer
- Contains signup_date, acquisition channel, risk_tier_at_signup, and demographic buckets (income_band, region, age_band)
- Used to define customer cohorts, segment performance, and build customer-level features for LTV / churn / PD modeling

**applications**
- One row per credit application
- Contains application date, approval/decline decision, approved amount, and a synthetic decision_score with reason codes for declines
- Used to analyze conversion funnels, approval rates, underwriting shifts over time, and credit policy tightening/loosening

**loans**
- One row per booked loan
- Contains origination details (principal, term_months, apr, origination fees), merchant category, and lifecycle outcomes (loan_status, default_date)
- Used as the central table for portfolio analytics, risk segmentation, PD/LGD/EAD construction, and cohort/vintage analysis

**payment_schedule**
- One row per contractual installment
- Contains due_date and the contractual split between due_principal and due_fee_interest, plus scheduled remaining balance
- Used to measure scheduled cash flows, delinquency timing, and to establish the “what should have happened” baseline for forecasting and variance analysis

**payments**
- One row per cash event
- Contains payment_date, payment_amount, split between paid_principal and paid_fee_interest, plus payment_type (scheduled, partial, refund, recovery)
- Used to measure actual cash collections, revenue realized through fees/interest, delinquency behavior, recoveries after default, and net loss outcomes

**macro_monthly**
- One row per month per scenario
- Contains monthly macro indexes (unemployment_index, rates_index, consumer_stress_index) for baseline, adverse, and severe scenarios
- Used for stress testing, scenario comparison, and macro-driven sensitivity analysis of delinquency/default behavior and portfolio losses

**budget_plan_monthly**
- One row per month per plan scenario
- Contains planned originations, cash inflow, revenue, and net losses under base vs stretch plans
- Used for budget vs actual variance modeling, planning accuracy evaluation, and “what management expected vs what happened” analysis

**dim_month**
- Calendar spine to help with time series modeling.
- This is an additional "tool" to help with the calculation. Not data in itself.

## The Main Report - Key Questions Answered

### 1 — Forecasting & Financial Planning

<br>

**1.1. Revenue Performance & Outlook**

How did total portfolio interest and fee revenue perform on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025, and what is the expected monthly revenue performance over the next 12 months?

**Tables used**
- payments
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Filter gross revenue ( **paid_fee_interest** ) for all **payment_type** labeled **scheduled** or **partial**.
- Aggregate monthly realized interest and fee revenue using **payment_date**, converted to a **year_month** configuration.
- Left join to a calendar spine to ensure zero-revenue months are included.
- SQL Output : a simple table with two columns, **year_month** and **gross_revenue**.

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly revenue output from SQL and index it by `year_month` as a monthly time series (`.asfreq("MS")`).
- Run STL decomposition (`period=12`) and plot the trend, seasonal, and residual components to diagnose revenue structure.
- Fit the historical monthly revenue series into a seasonal SARIMA model to capture short-term dynamics and yearly seasonality.
- Generate a 12-month forecast and extract the forecast table (`mean`, `mean_ci_lower`, `mean_ci_upper`).
- Plot actual vs forecast and shade the confidence interval to visually communicate expected trajectory and uncertainty.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_1_revenue_performance_and_outlook_b_SARIMAX.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**

- Monthly interest and fee revenue increases steadily from 2023 to 2025, with faster growth in 2024–2025 compared to 2023.
- The trend component is smooth and strongly upward across the full period.
- Revenue follows a predictable yearly pattern, but these seasonal ups and downs are much smaller than the overall growth.
- The seasonal component shows a consistent yearly pattern, with revenue tending to be higher toward the end of each year.
- Seasonal fluctuations are stable over time and materially smaller than the overall growth trend.
- The 12-month SARIMA forecast shows revenue continuing to rise beyond 2025, with even the conservative (lower-bound) forecast increasing over time.
- Forecast uncertainty increases gradually over the horizon, but the lower confidence bound remains well above earlier historical revenue levels.

<br><br>

**1.2. Cash Inflows vs Contractual Expectations**

How do actual cash collections compare to scheduled payments on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025?
How stable / reliable are monthly collection gaps across this period?

**Tables used**
- **payment_schedule** , contractual principal and interest due
- **payments** , actual cash collected
- **dim_month** ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Aggregate monthly scheduled cash flows from **payment_schedule**.
- Aggregate monthly actual cash flows from payments.
- Align both series on the same monthly calendar spine.
- Compute monthly cash collection gaps -> gap amount = actual − scheduled
- SQL output: one clean monthly table with columns(**year_month**, **scheduled_cash**, **actual_cash**, **cash_flow_gap**)

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly table that shows how much cash was expected and how much cash was actually collected for each month.
- For each month, calculate the cash gap percentage by dividing the difference between actual and expected cash by the expected cash.
- Summarize the results by reporting the average gap percentage, how much the gap percentage varies from month to month, and how often monthly cash collection is below expectations.
- Plot the monthly cash gap percentage over time and label each month with its exact value so the chart is easy to read.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_2_scheduled_vs_actual_cash_flow.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Collections fall below schedule in most months, with about 86% of months collecting less cash than contractually expected.
- The typical monthly shortfall is modest and steady, averaging roughly 4–5% below plan.
- Large negative gaps are uncommon, as most months cluster within a narrow under-collection range.
- There is no sign of worsening over time, with the size and volatility of gaps remaining broadly stable from 2023 through 2025.

<br><br>

**1.3. Budget vs Actual Performance**

Did actual revenue earned, cash collected, and credit losses differ from what management planned?

<br>

**Tables used**
- budget_plan_monthly — planned revenue ($), cash inflow ($), net credit loss ($) by month + scenario
- payments — actual cash received and realized interest+fees
- loans — default event timing (only for labeling / cohorting if needed)
- calendar spine

<br>

**SQL Method :** <br>
This work produces two monthly tables that will eventually be joined on year_month, Monthly actuals table and Monthly budget table.

**Monthly Actuals** (what really happened) 
-> it has three columns, "**actual_revenue**" , "**actual_cash**" , "**actual_loss**", all in year_month.

For the "**actual_revenue**":
- Use the **payments** table.
- Keep only payments where **payment_type** IN ('scheduled','partial').
- Sum **paid_fee_interest** (interest + fees actually collected).
- Group results by **payment_date** month (year_month).
- Left join to **dim_month** so every month exists, and fill missing months with 0 revenue.

For the "**actual_cash**":
- Use the **payments** table.
- Sum **payment_amount** (all cash collected, regardless of type).
- Group results by **payment_date** month (**year_month**).
- Left join to **dim_month** so every month exists, and fill missing months with 0 cash.

For the "**actual_loss**":
- Use the **loans** table and keep only defaulted loans where **default_date** IS NOT NULL.
- Join those defaulted loans to payments by **loan_id**, keeping only payment rows where **payment_date** <= **default_date**.
- For each defaulted loan, sum **paid_principal** only for **payment_type** IN ('**scheduled**','**partial**') to get principal paid before default.
- Compute unpaid principal at default as: **principal** − **principal_paid_pre_default**.
- Group unpaid principal by the month of **default_date** to get monthly unpaid principal loss.
- Separately, from payments, sum **payment_amount** by month where **payment_type** = '**recovery**' to get monthly recoveries.
- Align both monthly series to **dim_month** so every month exists, and fill missing months with 0.
- Compute monthly net loss as: **unpaid_principal_loss** − **recovered_principal**.

**Monthly Budget** (what management had planned ) 
- Use the budget_plan_monthly source table at monthly grain (year_month).
- Budget values are already provided in a pivoted format with fixed scenarios and metrics.
- Select one row per year_month containing:
	**base_budget_for_revenue**
	**stretch_budget_for_revenue**
	**base_budget_for_cash**
	**stretch_budget_for_cash**
	**base_budget_for_loss**
	**stretch_budget_for_loss**
- Join to the calendar spine to ensure all months are present.
- Fill missing budget values with 0 to align with monthly actuals.
- Output a single monthly budget table to be joined to monthly actuals on year_month.

**Result** :
A table with these columns

**year_month**,

**actual_revenue**,
**budget_base_for_revenue**,
**budget_stretch_for_revenue**,

**actual_cash**,
**budget_base_for_cash**,
**budget_stretch_for_cash**,

**actual_loss**,
**budget_base_for_loss**,
**budget_stretch_for_loss**
  
<br>

**Python Method :**
- Read the pre-aggregated monthly budget vs actual CSV
- Compute monthly variance by subtracting each budget value (Base and Stretch) from the actual result, so each variance column directly measures how far real performance deviated from plan in dollars.
- Convert each monthly dollar variance into a percent of the budget, so the size of the gap is comparable across months; for losses, a positive percent means losses exceeded plan.
- This delivers 3 charts ( each for Revenue, Cash, Net Credit Loss ), each chart is a 2-row stacked figure. Top chart is the Budget VS Actual, bottom chart is the Monthly Variance % vs Base + Stretch with a zero line.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3a_budget_vs_actual_on_revenue.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Actual revenue is consistently above the Base budget, showing management planned conservatively.
- Actual revenue stays below the Stretch budget, indicating growth did not rely on overly aggressive assumptions.
- Revenue growth accelerates over time, especially in 2024–2025, driven by portfolio scale rather than one-off events.
- Monthly variance versus budget is small and stable, suggesting forecasting accuracy improved as the portfolio matured.

<br>
<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3b_budget_vs_actual_on_cash.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Actual cash collections exceed the Base plan every year, indicating stronger cash inflows than expected.
- Actual cash remains below the Stretch plan, confirming that upside assumptions were intentionally aggressive.
- Cash collections grow in line with portfolio expansion, without sudden drops or reversals.
- Month-to-month cash variance is low, signaling predictable borrower repayment behavior.

<br><br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3c_budget_vs_actual_on_credit_loss.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br><br>

**Key Insights**
- Actual credit losses are higher than both Base and Stretch budgets in most months.
- Losses show high month-to-month volatility, reflecting the uneven timing of defaults.
- Losses increase as the portfolio ages, consistent with loan seasoning effects.
- Large variance percentages are driven by low planned losses, not by extreme absolute loss levels.
- Across the whole period, the money lost from unpaid loans is small compared to the money the business earns and collects. Even in months where losses are higher than planned, the business still brings in far more cash than it loses, so it can easily absorb those losses.

<br><br>

### 2 — Borrower Activation, Churn & Value

<br>

**2.1. Customer Activation Timing**

How long does it take customers to activate into credit usage by originating their first loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — signup date and segmentation attributes
- loans — first loan origination date
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- **Identify first credit usage**: Join loans to customers and, for each customer, find the earliest loan origination date that occurs on or after the signup date. This ensures activation reflects the first valid use of credit.
- **Measure activation delay**: Calculate activation time as the number of days between customer signup and first loan origination.
- **Summarize by cohort**: Group customers by signup month and compute the average and median activation days for each cohort to compare how quickly different signup cohorts activate into borrowing.
- SQL output : a table with these columns : year_month, n_customers, avg_activation_days, median_activation_days

**Python Method**
- Compute and visualize activation-time metrics by signup month, applying a cutoff defined as last month in the data minus 18 months so that only fully observable cohorts are included in trend analysis.
  
<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/02_1_customer_activation_timing.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- The cutoff is set at 18 months before the latest data point because historical cohorts show that activation commonly occurs up to about one year after signup, and the additional buffer ensures cohorts are fully observed before analysis. Therefore, everything AFTER the cutoff line should not be considered for analytics.
- For fully observed cohorts (before the cutoff), both average and median activation days steadily decline, indicating faster activation over time.
- The median is consistently lower than the average, showing that activation times are right-skewed with a long tail of very late activators.
- The sharp drop in activation days after the cutoff is not meaningful because those cohorts are not fully observed.
- Activated customer counts increase while activation times decrease before the cutoff, indicating improved activation speed without sacrificing volume.
- Early cohorts show higher volatility in activation timing, likely due to process immaturity or smaller sample sizes.

<br>
<br>

**2.2. Borrower Inactivity & Churn Risk**

Which customers are likely to stop borrowing or become inactive after their initial loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — customer attributes
- loans — loan timing and frequency

**SQL Method**
- Build customer loan timeline: create one row per loan with customer_id, origination_date, and a loan sequence number per customer.
- Select the first loan per customer: keep only loan sequence = 1 to define first_loan_date for each customer.
- Find the second loan date (if any): for each customer, find the earliest origination_date where loan sequence = 2 as second_loan_date.
- Define the churn window: set window_end_date = first_loan_date + churn_window_days (use a fixed rule like 180 days).
- Create churn label: set churn_flag = 1 if second_loan_date is null or second_loan_date > window_end_date; otherwise churn_flag = 0.
- Create first-loan features: keep first-loan fields used for prediction (example: principal, term_months, apr, merchant category if relevant), using only information available at origination.
- Attach customer attributes (including signup_date): join to customers and bring in signup_date plus stable attributes (channel, risk tier at signup, income band, region, age band).
- Assemble customer-level churn table: output one row per customer with customer_id, signup_date, first_loan_date, second_loan_date, window_end_date, churn label, and features.

**Python Method**
- Compute and visualize activation-time metrics by signup month, applying a cutoff defined as last month in the data minus 18 months so that only fully observable cohorts are included in trend analysis.
