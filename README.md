# Consumer Credit “Cica PRIME” Risk & Portfolio Analytics  
**Risk Management • Portfolio Analytics • Forecasting • Stress Testing**

This project analyzes synthetic but realistic consumer installment lending data from CICA (Consumer Installment Credit Account) Prime, a simulated consumer credit product designed to resemble real-world installment lending / BNPL-style portfolios offered by fintechs and traditional banks. The product extends unsecured credit to consumers and generates revenue through interest and fees, while incurring credit losses through delinquency and default.

The dataset spans January 2023 to December 2025 and includes loan-level, customer-level, and payment-level data, along with contractual payment schedules, macroeconomic scenarios, and internal budget plans. The data captures the full credit lifecycle: customer acquisition, underwriting decisions, loan origination, repayment behavior, delinquency, default, recoveries, and portfolio-level financial outcomes.

The analysis focuses on risk-aware, finance-aligned analytics, modeling how portfolio growth, repayment behavior, and credit losses are expected to evolve over time under different conditions. The goal is to evaluate portfolio health, revenue sustainability, and downside risk using predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, and scenario-based stress testing, consistent with how consumer lending analytics teams operate in practice.

➤ **Project Goal / Purpose:**  

The goal of this project is to understand how CICA Prime’s consumer lending portfolio grows over time, how stable that growth is, and how exposed the business is to downside risk. The analysis uses forecasting, predictive modeling, and standard credit risk techniques commonly applied in consumer lending.

The project looks at how revenue, cash inflows, delinquency, and defaults are expected to change over time, and compares actual results to internal plans to evaluate how accurate and resilient the business’s financial planning is. At the borrower and loan level, the analysis estimates customer lifetime value, the likelihood that borrowers stop using the product, and the likelihood that loans default, with the goal of using past behavior to make informed predictions about future outcomes.

At the portfolio level, the project measures expected credit losses, evaluates how concentrated revenue and risk are across borrowers, and tests how the portfolio would perform under different economic conditions. The goal is to determine whether portfolio growth is supported by sustainable cash flows and manageable credit risk, or whether it relies on elevated risk, loose underwriting, or a small group of borrowers—especially when economic conditions worsen.
