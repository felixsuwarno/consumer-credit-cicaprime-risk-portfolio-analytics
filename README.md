# Consumer Lending “Cica PRIME” Credit Risk and Portfolio Analytics  
**Risk Management • Portfolio Analytics • Forecasting • Stress Testing**

This project analyzes synthetic but realistic consumer installment lending data from CICA (Consumer Installment Credit Account) Prime, a simulated consumer credit product designed to resemble real-world installment lending / BNPL-style portfolios offered by fintechs and traditional banks. The product extends unsecured credit to consumers and generates revenue through interest and fees, while incurring credit losses through delinquency and default.

The dataset spans January 2023 to December 2025 and includes loan-level, customer-level, and payment-level data, along with contractual payment schedules, macroeconomic scenarios, and internal budget plans. The data captures the full credit lifecycle: customer acquisition, underwriting decisions, loan origination, repayment behavior, delinquency, default, recoveries, and portfolio-level financial outcomes.

The analysis focuses on risk-aware, finance-aligned analytics, modeling how portfolio growth, repayment behavior, and credit losses are expected to evolve over time under different conditions. The goal is to evaluate portfolio health, revenue sustainability, and downside risk using predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, and scenario-based stress testing, consistent with how consumer lending analytics teams operate in practice.

<br><br>

➤ **Project Goal / Purpose:**  

The goal of this project is to understand how CICA Prime’s consumer lending portfolio grows over time, how stable that growth is, and how exposed the business is to downside risk. The analysis uses forecasting, predictive modeling, and standard credit risk techniques commonly applied in consumer lending.

The project looks at how revenue, cash inflows, delinquency, and defaults are expected to change over time, and compares actual results to internal plans to evaluate how accurate and resilient the business’s financial planning is. At the borrower and loan level, the analysis estimates customer lifetime value, the likelihood that borrowers stop using the product, and the likelihood that loans default, with the goal of using past behavior to make informed predictions about future outcomes.

At the portfolio level, the project measures expected credit losses, evaluates how concentrated revenue and risk are across borrowers, and tests how the portfolio would perform under different economic conditions. The goal is to determine whether portfolio growth is supported by sustainable cash flows and manageable credit risk, or whether it relies on elevated risk, loose underwriting, or a small group of borrowers—especially when economic conditions worsen.

**➤ The Dataset**

The raw dataset spans January 2023 through December 2025, and all reporting and conclusions in this project are intentionally scoped to this full three-year period to evaluate portfolio growth, seasonality, underwriting changes, and macro-driven risk cycles, while supporting time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, portfolio risk analytics, and stress testing in a consistent analytical framework.

The analysis uses seven core tables representing a consumer installment lending product (“CICA Prime”):

**customers**
- One row per customer
- Contains signup_date, acquisition channel, risk_tier_at_signup, and demographic buckets (income_band, region, age_band)
- Used to define customer cohorts, segment performance, and build customer-level features for LTV / churn / PD modeling

**applications**
- One row per credit application
- Contains application date, approval/decline decision, approved amount, and a synthetic decision_score with reason codes for declines
- Used to analyze conversion funnels, approval rates, underwriting shifts over time, and credit policy tightening/loosening

**loans**
- One row per booked loan
- Contains origination details (principal, term_months, apr, origination fees), merchant category, and lifecycle outcomes (loan_status, default_date)
- Used as the central table for portfolio analytics, risk segmentation, PD/LGD/EAD construction, and cohort/vintage analysis

**payment_schedule**
- One row per contractual installment
- Contains due_date and the contractual split between due_principal and due_fee_interest, plus scheduled remaining balance
- Used to measure scheduled cash flows, delinquency timing, and to establish the “what should have happened” baseline for forecasting and variance analysis

**payments**
- One row per cash event
- Contains payment_date, payment_amount, split between paid_principal and paid_fee_interest, plus payment_type (scheduled, partial, refund, recovery)
- Used to measure actual cash collections, revenue realized through fees/interest, delinquency behavior, recoveries after default, and net loss outcomes

**macro_monthly**
- One row per month per scenario
- Contains monthly macro indexes (unemployment_index, rates_index, consumer_stress_index) for baseline, adverse, and severe scenarios
- Used for stress testing, scenario comparison, and macro-driven sensitivity analysis of delinquency/default behavior and portfolio losses

**budget_plan_monthly**
- One row per month per plan scenario
- Contains planned originations, cash inflow, revenue, and net losses under base vs stretch plans
- Used for budget vs actual variance modeling, planning accuracy evaluation, and “what management expected vs what happened” analysis

**dim_month**
- Calendar spine to help with time series modeling.
- This is an additional "tool" to help with the calculation. Not data in itself.

## The Main Report - Key Questions Answered

### 1 — Forecasting & Financial Planning

<br>

**1.1. Revenue Performance & Outlook**

How did total portfolio interest and fee revenue perform on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025, and what is the expected monthly revenue performance over the next 12 months?

**Tables used**
- payments
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Filter gross revenue ( **paid_fee_interest** ) for all **payment_type** labeled **scheduled** or **partial**.
- Aggregate monthly realized interest and fee revenue using **payment_date**, converted to a **year_month** configuration.
- Left join to a calendar spine to ensure zero-revenue months are included.
- SQL Output : a simple table with two columns, **year_month** and **gross_revenue**.

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly revenue output from SQL and index it by `year_month` as a monthly time series (`.asfreq("MS")`).
- Run STL decomposition (`period=12`) and plot the trend, seasonal, and residual components to diagnose revenue structure.
- Fit the historical monthly revenue series into a seasonal SARIMA model to capture short-term dynamics and yearly seasonality.
- Generate a 12-month forecast and extract the forecast table (`mean`, `mean_ci_lower`, `mean_ci_upper`).
- Plot actual vs forecast and shade the confidence interval to visually communicate expected trajectory and uncertainty.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_1_revenue_performance_and_outlook_b_SARIMAX.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**

- Revenue rose consistently from 2023 through 2025 as the loan portfolio expanded and more borrowers generated interest and fee income. 
- Early-stage growth was rapid due to the small starting base, while later growth reflects a more mature and scaled lending operation.
- The upward movement is mainly driven by portfolio expansion rather than strong seasonal effects.
- Month-to-month revenue fluctuations remain moderate relative to the overall growth trend, indicating stable performance.
- The 12-month forecast points to continued growth if current portfolio dynamics persist.

All revenue figures reflect cash actually collected from borrowers, ensuring alignment with real liquidity rather than accounting estimates.

<br><br>

**1.2. Cash Inflows vs Contractual Expectations**

How do actual cash collections compare to scheduled payments on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025?
How stable / reliable are monthly collection gaps across this period?

**Tables used**
- **payment_schedule** , contractual principal and interest due
- **payments** , actual cash collected
- **dim_month** ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Aggregate monthly scheduled cash flows from **payment_schedule**.
- Aggregate monthly actual cash flows from payments.
- Align both series on the same monthly calendar spine.
- Compute monthly cash collection gaps -> gap amount = actual − scheduled
- SQL output: one clean monthly table with columns(**year_month**, **scheduled_cash**, **actual_cash**, **cash_flow_gap**)

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly table that shows how much cash was expected and how much cash was actually collected for each month.
- For each month, calculate the cash gap percentage by dividing the difference between actual and expected cash by the expected cash.
- Summarize the results by reporting the average gap percentage, how much the gap percentage varies from month to month, and how often monthly cash collection is below expectations.
- Plot the monthly cash gap percentage over time and label each month with its exact value so the chart is easy to read.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_2_scheduled_vs_actual_cash_flow.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Actual cash collected falls short of scheduled cash in the large majority of months (32 out of 35), indicating a consistent collection gap.
- On average, monthly collections are about 4–5% below contractual expectations.
- Over-collection occurs rarely and only by small margins, suggesting upside surprises are limited.
- The largest shortfall occurred early in the portfolio lifecycle, with performance stabilizing in later periods.
- Month-to-month variation in the gap is moderate, showing the shortfall pattern is persistent rather than random.

<br><br>

**1.3. Budget vs Actual Performance**

Did actual revenue earned, cash collected, and credit losses differ from what management planned?

<br>

**Tables used**
- budget_plan_monthly — planned revenue ($), cash inflow ($), net credit loss ($) by month + scenario
- payments — actual cash received and realized interest+fees
- loans — default event timing (only for labeling / cohorting if needed)
- calendar spine

<br>

**SQL Method :** <br>
This work produces three tables.

**Actual Revenue:**
- **Identify realized revenue cashflows:** Use the payments table and keep only rows where payment_type IN ('scheduled','partial') so revenue reflects interest/fees actually collected.
- **Aggregate to monthly revenue:** Group by payment_date month and sum paid_fee_interest to produce actual_revenue by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months:** Left join the monthly revenue series to dim_month on month_start so every month appears even when revenue is zero, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Output the revenue table:** Return **year_month** and **actual_revenue** ordered by **year_month**. 

**Actual Cash:**
- **Identify all cash collected:** Use the payments table and include all payment rows so this metric captures total cash inflow, not just revenue.
- **Aggregate to monthly cash:** Group by payment_date month and sum payment_amount to produce actual_cash by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months:** Left join the monthly cash series to dim_month on month_start so every month appears even when cash is zero, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Output the cash table:** Return **year_month** and **actual_cash** ordered by **year_month**.

**Actual Net Credit Loss:**
- **Identify default events:** Filter loans to only defaulted loans where **default_date** IS NOT NULL so losses are tied to actual defaults.
- **Measure unpaid principal at default:** Left join defaulted loans to payments on loan_id and keep only payments with **payment_date** <= **default_date**, then sum paid_principal for payment_type IN ('scheduled','partial') to compute principal_paid_pre_default.
- **Aggregate monthly principal loss:** For each defaulted loan compute principal - **principal_paid_pre_default** and sum by the month of default_date to produce **actual_loss_unpaid_principal** by year_month.
- **Preserve missing months for loss:** Left join monthly principal loss to **dim_month** so every month appears, and fill missing months with 0.
- **Measure monthly recoveries:** From payments, filter to payment_type = **'recovery'** and sum **payment_amount** by month to produce **actual_loss_recovered_principal**.
- **Compute monthly net loss:** For each month compute **actual_loss** = **actual_loss_unpaid_principal** - **actual_loss_recovered_principal**, using 0 for missing recoveries, and output **year_month** and **actual_loss** ordered by month.

<br>

**Python Method :**

**Budget vs Actual Revenue:**
- Load monthly actual revenue and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual revenue months with 0 so “no activity” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget revenue series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned revenue per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual revenue to the two budget revenue series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance.
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Budget vs Actual Cash:**
- Load monthly actual cash and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual cash months with 0 so “no activity” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget cash series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned cash inflow per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual cash to the two budget cash series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance.
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Budget vs Actual Net Credit Loss:**
- Load monthly actual net credit loss and monthly budget plan data, and convert the month fields into real dates so the timeline is consistent.
- Align both datasets to a monthly calendar index so every month exists in order, then fill missing actual loss months with 0 so “no loss recorded” is treated as 0.
- Build two budget loss series (Base and Stretch) by filtering the budget data by scenario and aggregating planned net losses per month, then join them side-by-side.
- Join actual loss to the two budget loss series by month so each month has Actual, Budget(Base), and Budget(Stretch).
- Compute variance in dollars (Actual − Budget) and variance percent ((Actual − Budget) ÷ Budget) for both Base and Stretch, treating 0-budget months as undefined percent variance; interpret positive variance as “losses worse than plan.”
- Plot a two-panel chart: top panel shows Actual vs Base vs Stretch in dollars; bottom panel shows monthly variance percent vs Base and Stretch with a zero line.

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3a_budget_vs_actual_on_revenue.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Revenue grew steadily from 2023 through 2025, reflecting consistent portfolio expansion.
- During 2023 and most of 2024, actual revenue remained above the base plan, indicating stronger monetization than management initially forecasted.
- Performance periodically approached the stretch target in 2024, showing that growth was temporarily aligned with aggressive expectations.
- In 2025, revenue continued rising in absolute dollars but began underperforming both base and stretch plans, signaling a slowdown relative to budgeted growth.
- The variance trend shows a shift from outperformance in early years to underperformance later, suggesting planning assumptions became more aggressive than realized revenue growth.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3b_budget_vs_actual_on_cash.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- Cash collections increased each year, reflecting portfolio expansion and higher repayment volumes.
- Actual cash fell below the base plan in nearly every month after early 2023, indicating consistent underperformance versus management expectations.
- The shortfall versus stretch targets was larger and persistent, showing that the aggressive growth scenario was not achieved.
- The variance trend shows the deviation becoming more negative over time, meaning the difference between expected and realized cash did not correct as the portfolio matured.
- By late 2025, the cash gap reached its widest levels, signaling structural pressure on liquidity relative to plan.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_3c_budget_vs_actual_on_credit_loss.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Actual credit losses were much higher than planned in most months after early 2024.
- Losses increased sharply and stayed high through 2025, far above what the budget expected.
- Instead of rising slowly and smoothly, losses jumped in spikes, meaning defaults happened in waves.
- The difference between planned and actual losses became very large, especially during peak months.
- Compared to revenue and cash, credit losses were the biggest source of budget problems.

<br><br>

**1.4. Delinquency & Default Trends**<br><br>
Did borrowers begin falling behind on payments before credit losses increased sharply?

<br>

**Tables used**
- payment_schedule
- payments
- loans
- dim_month

<br>

**SQL Method**

To create the required table, the process is complex. Therefore, the SQL logic was separated into four sequential scripts. Each script must be executed in order. This approach mimics how real banks structure data pipelines. Breaking the logic into smaller steps reduces cognitive load, makes debugging easier, and allows each stage to be verified independently.

**01_4a — Scheduled Payment Plan**
- Build a month-end calendar from **dim_month** so each reporting month has a consistent **month_end** date.
- Join **payment_schedule** to the calendar using **due_date** <= **month_end** so each installment is counted once it becomes due.
- Aggregate to one row per **loan_id** + **month_end** and sum **due_total** to compute **due_at_month_end**.
- Output the cumulative contractual amount that should have been paid by each month-end.

**01_4b — Collected Payments**
- Build a month-end calendar from **dim_month**.
- Clean payments at the daily level: Keep **scheduled** and **partial** as positive and then convert **refund** to negative.
- Join cleaned payments to month-end using **payment_date** <= **month_end** so payments accumulate through time.
- Aggregate to one row per **loan_id** + **month_end** and sum as **paid_at_month_end**.
- Output the cumulative cash actually paid by each month-end.

**01_4c — Delinquency at Month-End**
- Join **scheduled** vs **paid** tables at **loan_id** + **month_end**.
- Compute **unpaid_at_month_end** as **due_at_month_end** − **paid_at_month_end**, floored at zero.
- For loans with unpaid balance, join back to payment_schedule to identify all due installments on or before month_end.
- For each loan-month, compute **oldest_unpaid_due_date** using MIN(due_date).
- Calculate dpd_days as the difference between **month_end** and **oldest_unpaid_due_date**.
- Assign **dpd_bucket** based on **dpd_days** (Current, 1–29, 30–59, 60–89, 90+).
- Output one clean loan-level delinquency snapshot per month-end.

**01_4d — Portfolio Delinquency Trend**
- Aggregate **01_4c_delinquency_at_month_end** by year_month:
  - Count total active loans.
  - Count loans in each DPD bucket.
- Compute **dpd_30_plus_rate** as (30–59 + 60–89 + 90+) divided by total active loans.
- Separately aggregate loans to count defaulted_loans by default month.
- Join delinquency metrics to monthly defaults.
- Output one monthly portfolio table showing delinquency trend and default trend side-by-side.

<br>

**Python Method**

- **Load the monthly trend dataset:** Read 01_4d_portfolio_delinquency_trend.csv, parse year_month as a date, sort by time, and set year_month as the time index so each row represents one month.
- **Standardize column names for stability:** Normalize column names (trim spaces, lowercase, replace spaces with underscores) so later steps do not break due to formatting differences.
- **Normalize the 30+ delinquency metric:** Identify the DPD 30+ rate column and convert it into a consistent percentage series so it is comparable month to month.
- **Smooth the signals for trend reading:** Compute a 3-month rolling average for DPD 30+ rate and for monthly defaulted loans to reduce noise and make the direction of change easier to see.
- **Convert bucket counts into portfolio mix shares:** If delinquency bucket count columns exist (Current, 1–29, 30–59, 60–89, 90+), divide each bucket by active_loans to create bucket share percentages for portfolio mix tracking.
- **Test whether delinquency leads defaults:** Run a lead/lag correlation check across multiple month lags to measure whether increases in DPD 30+ tend to show up before increases in defaults, and estimate the typical lead time in months.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_4a_delinquency_vs_default.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- DPD 30+ starts rising early and keeps trending upward.
- Defaults stay low at first, then increase later.
- Defaults move more sharply month-to-month; DPD rises more steadily.
- The rise in delinquency happens before the sustained rise in defaults.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_4b_dpd_bucket_shares_overtime.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**
- The share of Current loans gradually declines over time.
- The 90+ delinquency bucket steadily increases.
- Early delinquency (1–29) rises before severe delinquency builds.
- Loans appear to migrate from Current → early delinquency → severe delinquency over time.

<br><br>

### 2 — Borrower Activation, Churn & Value

<br>

**2.1. Customer Activation Timing**

How long does it take customers to activate into credit usage by originating their first loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — signup date and segmentation attributes
- loans — first loan origination date
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- **Identify first credit usage**: Join loans to customers and, for each customer, find the earliest loan origination date that occurs on or after the signup date. This ensures activation reflects the first valid use of credit.
- **Measure activation delay**: Calculate activation time as the number of days between customer signup and first loan origination.
- **Summarize by cohort**: Group customers by signup month and compute the average and median activation days for each cohort to compare how quickly different signup cohorts activate into borrowing.
- SQL output : a table with these columns : year_month, n_customers, avg_activation_days, median_activation_days

**Python Method**
- Compute and visualize activation-time metrics by signup month, applying a cutoff defined as last month in the data minus 18 months so that only fully observable cohorts are included in trend analysis.

**2.2. Borrower Inactivity & Churn Risk**

Which customers are likely to stop borrowing or become inactive after their initial loan?

**Tables used**
- customers — customer attributes
- loans — loan timing and frequency

**SQL Method**
- The initial loan is defined as the earliest loan origination for each customer, ordered by origination date and loan ID.
- **Order loans and set end date**: Assign a fixed portfolio end date (2025-12-31) and number each customer’s loans by origination date (and **loan_id** for ties) so we can consistently identify “first” and “second” loans.
- **Isolate the first loan**: Keep only **loan_number** = 1 per customer to define the **first_loan_id** and **first_loan_date**, which anchors the customer’s borrowing start.
- **Isolate the second loan**: Keep only **loan_number** = 2 per customer to capture the earliest “return borrowing” event (**second_loan_id**, **second_loan_date**) if it exists.
- **Create the 180-day return window**: Join first and second loans and compute **daydate_180** = **first_loan_date** + 180 days to define the return window boundary.
- **Apply an observability cutoff** (include_flag): Mark customers as included only if **daydate_180** is on or before 2025-12-31, so every included customer has a fully observable 180-day return window.
- **Calculate inactivity score** :
	- For customers who are not included the score is set to NULL
	- For included customers who has no second loan, assign score = 1
	- For included customers who has second loan which is within 180 days after the first loan, calculate score = days between loans ÷ 180
	- For included customers who has second loan which is outside 180 days after the first loan, assign score = 1
- **Output the modeling table** : Return one row per customer containing first/second loan timing, the 180-day window boundary, the include_flag, and the final inactive_score target for downstream Python work.

**Python Method**
- **Load the modeling table**: Read the SQL output (one row per borrowing customer) and keep only rows where inactive_score is not null so the target is fully observable.
- **Validate the target**: Convert inactive_score to numeric and keep only valid values so summaries and plots do not break or misread the target.
- **Measure portfolio-level full inactivity**: Compute the share of observable customers with inactive_score = 1.00 to quantify customers who did not return within 180 days.
- **Summarize return timing distribution**: Describe and plot the distribution of inactive_score to separate the “fully inactive” mass at 1.00 from the return-timing spread among customers who came back within 180 days.
- **Create outcome buckets for communication**: Bucket customers into Low/Medium/High groups using fixed thresholds on inactive_score so results are easy to explain and compare across segments.
