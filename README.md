# Consumer Credit “Cica PRIME” Risk & Portfolio Analytics  
**Risk Management • Portfolio Analytics • Forecasting • Stress Testing**

This project analyzes synthetic but realistic consumer installment lending data from CICA (Consumer Installment Credit Account) Prime, a simulated consumer credit product designed to resemble real-world installment lending / BNPL-style portfolios offered by fintechs and traditional banks. The product extends unsecured credit to consumers and generates revenue through interest and fees, while incurring credit losses through delinquency and default.

The dataset spans January 2023 to December 2025 and includes loan-level, customer-level, and payment-level data, along with contractual payment schedules, macroeconomic scenarios, and internal budget plans. The data captures the full credit lifecycle: customer acquisition, underwriting decisions, loan origination, repayment behavior, delinquency, default, recoveries, and portfolio-level financial outcomes.

The analysis focuses on risk-aware, finance-aligned analytics, modeling how portfolio growth, repayment behavior, and credit losses are expected to evolve over time under different conditions. The goal is to evaluate portfolio health, revenue sustainability, and downside risk using predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, and scenario-based stress testing, consistent with how consumer lending analytics teams operate in practice.

<br><br>

➤ **Project Goal / Purpose:**  

The goal of this project is to understand how CICA Prime’s consumer lending portfolio grows over time, how stable that growth is, and how exposed the business is to downside risk. The analysis uses forecasting, predictive modeling, and standard credit risk techniques commonly applied in consumer lending.

The project looks at how revenue, cash inflows, delinquency, and defaults are expected to change over time, and compares actual results to internal plans to evaluate how accurate and resilient the business’s financial planning is. At the borrower and loan level, the analysis estimates customer lifetime value, the likelihood that borrowers stop using the product, and the likelihood that loans default, with the goal of using past behavior to make informed predictions about future outcomes.

At the portfolio level, the project measures expected credit losses, evaluates how concentrated revenue and risk are across borrowers, and tests how the portfolio would perform under different economic conditions. The goal is to determine whether portfolio growth is supported by sustainable cash flows and manageable credit risk, or whether it relies on elevated risk, loose underwriting, or a small group of borrowers—especially when economic conditions worsen.

**➤ The Dataset**

The raw dataset spans January 2023 through December 2025, and all reporting and conclusions in this project are intentionally scoped to this full three-year period to evaluate portfolio growth, seasonality, underwriting changes, and macro-driven risk cycles, while supporting time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, portfolio risk analytics, and stress testing in a consistent analytical framework.

The analysis uses seven core tables representing a consumer installment lending product (“CICA Prime”):

**customers**
- One row per customer
- Contains signup_date, acquisition channel, risk_tier_at_signup, and demographic buckets (income_band, region, age_band)
- Used to define customer cohorts, segment performance, and build customer-level features for LTV / churn / PD modeling

**applications**
- One row per credit application
- Contains application date, approval/decline decision, approved amount, and a synthetic decision_score with reason codes for declines
- Used to analyze conversion funnels, approval rates, underwriting shifts over time, and credit policy tightening/loosening

**loans**
- One row per booked loan
- Contains origination details (principal, term_months, apr, origination fees), merchant category, and lifecycle outcomes (loan_status, default_date)
- Used as the central table for portfolio analytics, risk segmentation, PD/LGD/EAD construction, and cohort/vintage analysis

**payment_schedule**
- One row per contractual installment
- Contains due_date and the contractual split between due_principal and due_fee_interest, plus scheduled remaining balance
- Used to measure scheduled cash flows, delinquency timing, and to establish the “what should have happened” baseline for forecasting and variance analysis

**payments**
- One row per cash event
- Contains payment_date, payment_amount, split between paid_principal and paid_fee_interest, plus payment_type (scheduled, partial, refund, recovery)
- Used to measure actual cash collections, revenue realized through fees/interest, delinquency behavior, recoveries after default, and net loss outcomes

**macro_monthly**
- One row per month per scenario
- Contains monthly macro indexes (unemployment_index, rates_index, consumer_stress_index) for baseline, adverse, and severe scenarios
- Used for stress testing, scenario comparison, and macro-driven sensitivity analysis of delinquency/default behavior and portfolio losses

**budget_plan_monthly**
- One row per month per plan scenario
- Contains planned originations, cash inflow, revenue, and net losses under base vs stretch plans
- Used for budget vs actual variance modeling, planning accuracy evaluation, and “what management expected vs what happened” analysis

**dim_month**
- Calendar spine to help with time series modeling.
- This is an additional "tool" to help with the calculation. Not data in itself.

## The Main Report - Key Questions Answered

### 1 — Forecasting & Financial Planning

<br>

**1.1. Revenue Performance & Outlook**

How did total portfolio interest and fee revenue perform on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025, and what is the expected monthly revenue performance over the next 12 months?

**Tables used**
- payments
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Filter gross revenue (`paid_fee_interest`) for all `payment_type` labeled `scheduled` or `partial`.
- Aggregate monthly realized interest and fee revenue using `payment_date`, converted to a `year_month` configuration.
- Left join to a calendar spine to ensure zero-revenue months are included.
- SQL Output : a simple table with two columns, year_month and gross_revenue.

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly revenue output from SQL and index it by `year_month` as a monthly time series (`.asfreq("MS")`).
- Run STL decomposition (`period=12`) and plot the trend, seasonal, and residual components to diagnose revenue structure.
- Fit the historical monthly revenue series into a seasonal SARIMA model to capture short-term dynamics and yearly seasonality.
- Generate a 12-month forecast and extract the forecast table (`mean`, `mean_ci_lower`, `mean_ci_upper`).
- Plot actual vs forecast and shade the confidence interval to visually communicate expected trajectory and uncertainty.

  <img src="Charts/01_1_revenue_performance_and_outlook_b_SARIMAX.png" width="100%">
</p>

**Key Insights**

- Monthly interest and fee revenue increases steadily from 2023 to 2025, with faster growth in 2024–2025 compared to 2023.
- The trend component is smooth and strongly upward across the full period.
- Revenue follows a predictable yearly pattern, but these seasonal ups and downs are much smaller than the overall growth.
- The seasonal component shows a consistent yearly pattern, with revenue tending to be higher toward the end of each year.
- Seasonal fluctuations are stable over time and materially smaller than the overall growth trend.
- The 12-month SARIMA forecast shows revenue continuing to rise beyond 2025, with even the conservative (lower-bound) forecast increasing over time.
- Forecast uncertainty increases gradually over the horizon, but the lower confidence bound remains well above earlier historical revenue levels.

<br><br>

**1.2. Cash Inflows vs Contractual Expectations**

How do actual cash collections compare to scheduled payments on a monthly basis from 2023 through 2025?
How stable / reliable are monthly collection gaps across this period?

**Tables used**
- payment_schedule , contractual principal and interest due
- payments , actual cash collected
- dim_month ( the calendar spine )

**SQL Method**
- Aggregate monthly scheduled cash flows from payment_schedule.
- Aggregate monthly actual cash flows from payments.
- Align both series on the same monthly calendar spine.
- Compute monthly cash collection gaps -> gap amount = actual − scheduled
- SQL output: one clean monthly table with columns(year_month, scheduled_cash, actual_cash, cash_flow_gap)

**Python Method**
- Load the monthly table that shows how much cash was expected and how much cash was actually collected for each month.
- For each month, calculate the cash gap percentage by dividing the difference between actual and expected cash by the expected cash.
- Summarize the results by reporting the average gap percentage, how much the gap percentage varies from month to month, and how often monthly cash collection is below expectations.
- Plot the monthly cash gap percentage over time and label each month with its exact value so the chart is easy to read.

<br>

**Charts**

<p align="center">
  <img src="Charts/01_2_scheduled_vs_actual_cash_flow.png" width="100%">
</p>

<br>

**Key Insights**
- Collections fall below schedule in most months, with about 86% of months collecting less cash than contractually expected.
- The typical monthly shortfall is modest and steady, averaging roughly 4–5% below plan.
- Large negative gaps are uncommon, as most months cluster within a narrow under-collection range.
- There is no sign of worsening over time, with the size and volatility of gaps remaining broadly stable from 2023 through 2025.

<br><br>

**1.3. Budget vs Actual Performance**

Did actual revenue earned, cash collected, and credit losses differ from what management planned?

<br>

**Tables used**
- budget_plan_monthly — planned revenue ($), cash inflow ($), net credit loss ($) by month + scenario
- payments — actual cash received and realized interest+fees
- loans — default event timing (only for labeling / cohorting if needed)
- calendar spine

<br>

**SQL Method :**
- Aggregate monthly actual realized revenue from payments (sum of paid_fee_interest, using payment_date -> year_month, filtering to true customer payments such as scheduled and partial).
- Aggregate monthly actual cash inflows from payments (sum of payment_amount, using payment_date -> year_month, treating recoveries as positive and refunds as negative so it is net cash).
- Aggregate monthly actual net credit losses using one consistent rule (use default_date -> year_month to time the write-off, then subtract recovery cash received in the same month).
- Aggregate monthly budgeted revenue, cash inflows, and losses from budget_plan_monthly by year_month and scenario.
- Align actuals and budgets on the same monthly calendar spine and join by year_month + scenario.
- Compute monthly variances for each metric -> variance_abs = actual − budget, variance_pct = (actual − budget) / budget.
- SQL output: one clean monthly table with columns (year_month, scenario, revenue_actual, revenue_budget, revenue_var_abs, revenue_var_pct, cash_actual, cash_budget, cash_var_abs, cash_var_pct, loss_actual, loss_budget, loss_var_abs, loss_var_pct).
